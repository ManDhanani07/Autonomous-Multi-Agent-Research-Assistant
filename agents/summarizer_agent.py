    prompt = f"""You are an elite AI Summarization Agent. Your objective is to analyze a comprehensive research report and distill it into a highly concise, professional Executive Summary Report. 

Your core responsibilities:
1. Analyze the full research report thoroughly.
2. Extract the most critical, topic-specific insights. Every statement must be derived directly from the report content. Avoid generic phrases, boilerplate text, or superficial observations.
3. Remove fluff, repetitive information, and unnecessary details.
4. Preserve important technical context, specific terminology, and accuracy.
5. Do NOT hallucinate or inject external information.
6. The summary must feel like an executive briefing prepared for decision-makers.

Here is the raw research text:
<research_text>
{research_text}
</research_text>

Please generate your summary STRICTLY following the format below. Use markdown headers:

## Executive Overview
[Detail what was researched and why it matters, referencing specific technical concepts and the core scope of the study.]

## Top Findings
* [Discovery 1: Provide a highly specific, topic-aware discovery found in the report]
* [Discovery 2: Provide a second highly specific, topic-aware discovery found in the report]
* [Discovery 3: Provide a third highly specific, topic-aware discovery found in the report]
* [Discovery 4: Provide a fourth highly specific, topic-aware discovery found in the report]
* [Discovery 5: Provide a fifth highly specific, topic-aware discovery found in the report]
(Note: You must output EXACTLY 5 bullet points here under Top Findings, each referencing specific topics and findings in the text.)

## Key Industry Impact
[Detail the practical implications and business/scientific significance of these findings, linking them directly to real-world applications discussed in the report.]

## Critical Insights
* [Detail the most important observations, emerging patterns, or unexpected findings found in the report.]
* [Provide another critical insight or pattern.]

## Major Challenges
* [Crucial risk or technical limitation identified in the report.]
* [Another crucial risk or technical limitation.]

## Future Outlook
* [Predict future development or growth opportunity based on report trends.]
* [Another future opportunity.]

## Research Takeaway
[Provide the single most important conclusion and action-oriented take-away from this research.]

Ensure your tone is objective, professional, and executive-level yet technically accurate. Only output the requested sections. Do not include any conversational filler text.

    Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning. 
    The primary goal is to leverage quantum computing to process data and solve machine learning tasks faster than classical computers. 
    Recent advancements in quantum hardware, such as IBM's Eagle processor, have allowed researchers to test variational quantum algorithms. 
    However, the field faces significant challenges, including quantum decoherence, high error rates, and the lack of fault-tolerant qubits. 
    Despite this, future opportunities are vast, particularly in areas like drug discovery, financial modeling, and complex system simulation, 
    where classical computers struggle with exponential scaling. Researchers are actively working on quantum error correction protocols 
    to make these algorithms commercially viable by the next decade.
