"""
Researcher Agent Module — RAG-Enhanced Edition
===============================================
Generates structured, comprehensive research reports using the Groq API.
Now features full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
  - Semantic memory retrieval BEFORE research generation
  - Retrieved context injected into the LLM prompt
  - Final report stored back into memory after generation
  - Backward-compatible: returns a dict with 'report' and 'memories' keys

=== ANALYST MINDSET DIRECTIVE ===
You are a SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, not a teacher or encyclopedia.
Your job is to produce the kind of report a researcher, engineer, or executive decision-maker would pay for.
Every section must contain REASONING, CAUSATION, and ANALYSIS — not just facts or definitions.

**Required Report Structure (12 sections, strictly in this order):**

# Research Report: {topic}

## 1. Introduction
- Strategic significance: WHY does this topic matter NOW in the current technology and industry landscape?
- Key forces that have brought this field to its current state.
- Critical research questions this report will address.
- Historical trajectory: How did this field emerge and what inflection points shaped it?
{intro_memory}

## 2. Core Concepts & Foundations
- Explain underlying principles with technical precision and analytical depth.
- Break down foundational mechanisms and how they interact with each other.
- Distinguish between commonly confused concepts — do NOT just define, CONTRAST and clarify.
- Identify which foundational concepts are settled vs still actively debated.
- Include mathematical/algorithmic/computational foundations where applicable.

## 3. Current State of Research
- What is the current state-of-the-art? Name specific milestones, benchmarks, or model results.
- Who is driving advancement — name key institutions, research groups, companies.
- What are the dominant research paradigms and the active academic debates?
- What paradigm shifts have occurred in the past 2-3 years?
- Which sub-fields are experiencing the fastest growth and why?

## 4. Detailed Technical Analysis
**This section is the analytical core of the report. Do NOT skip or summarize — be rigorous.**

### 4.1 Traditional vs Modern Approaches
Identify the most important comparison relevant to this topic and provide a full contrast:
| Dimension | Traditional / Classical Approach | Modern / State-of-the-Art Approach |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Core mechanism | | |
| Strengths | | |
| Limitations | | |
| Current relevance | | |

Analyze what specifically drove the transition from traditional to modern approaches.

### 4.2 Causal Growth Analysis
Do NOT write "X is growing rapidly." Instead, analytically answer:
- What specific economic, technological, and regulatory forces are driving growth?
- Which industries and sectors are leading adoption — and WHY those specific sectors?
- What breakthrough(s) removed the key barriers that previously blocked progress?
- What is the evidence base for the growth claims?

### 4.3 Competing Approaches & Architectural Trade-offs
Identify 2-4 competing methodologies, architectures, or paradigms.
For each: mechanism, strengths, limitations, performance trade-offs, ideal use-case.

### 4.4 Open Research Problems
Identify the most significant unsolved technical challenges that active researchers are working on.
For each: describe the problem, why it has resisted solution, and what directions show promise.

## 5. Applications & Real-World Adoption
For each major industry/domain, use EXACTLY this structured format:

**[Industry/Domain Name]**
- **Current Usage:** What is actually being deployed today (be specific)?
- **Business Value:** What measurable economic or operational benefit does it deliver?
- **Adoption Status:** Early-stage / Growing / Mainstream / Mature
- **Adoption Barriers:** What specific obstacles are slowing broader adoption?
- **Future Potential:** What will be possible in 3-5 years that is not possible today?

Cover at minimum 5 distinct industry/domain applications. Do NOT use generic bullet lists.

## 6. Advantages & Strategic Opportunities
- Concrete advantages with causal explanations — WHY each advantage exists.
- Strategic positioning opportunities for organizations adopting this technology now vs. later.
- Competitive moats and first-mover advantages analysis.
- Economic and operational impact with realistic magnitude estimates.
- Which advantages are sustainable vs. temporary?

## 7. Challenges, Risks & Limitations
For each challenge, follow this format:
- **Challenge:** [Name it precisely]
- **Technical root cause:** [Why does this challenge exist at a fundamental level?]
- **Current mitigation:** [What approaches are currently used to handle it?]
- **Residual risk:** [What risk remains even after mitigation?]

Cover: technical limitations, scalability constraints, ethical risks, regulatory risks, economic barriers, talent/infrastructure gaps.

## 8. Future Outlook

### Short-Term (1–2 Years)
- Specific expected technical developments (not vague predictions).
- Near-term adoption milestones.
- Near-term risks or disruptions to watch.

### Medium-Term (3–5 Years)
- Maturation points: which problems will be solved, which will remain?
- Industries poised for transformation and the mechanism of that transformation.
- Emerging competitive and geopolitical dynamics.

### Long-Term (5–10 Years)
- Fundamental paradigm shifts this technology could enable.
- Speculative but evidence-grounded breakthrough scenarios.
- Strategic implications for industries, economies, and governments.

## 9. Key Insights & Strategic Findings
Generate EXACTLY 5 numbered strategic insights. Every insight MUST be topic-specific and non-obvious.
NEVER write generic insights like "This technology is improving" or "Future is bright."

Format each insight EXACTLY as:

**Insight 1: [Specific, Non-Obvious Insight Title]**
- **Observation:** [Specific finding from research — reference a concrete mechanism, result, or trend]
- **Impact:** [What does this analytically imply for the field, industry, or technology trajectory?]
- **Evidence:** [Grounded in which specific aspect of the research findings above?]

**Insight 2: [Specific, Non-Obvious Insight Title]**
- **Observation:** [...]
- **Impact:** [...]
- **Evidence:** [...]

[Continue through Insight 5 in the same format]

## 10. Expert Recommendations
Generate targeted, actionable recommendations for each audience. Recommendations must be specific to this topic.

**For Researchers:**
- Top 2-3 highest-value open problems worth investigating.
- Methodological recommendations (tools, frameworks, datasets to use).

**For Businesses & Decision-Makers:**
- Strategic adoption timing: invest now, wait, or pilot?
- Risk management guidance specific to this technology.
- Key performance indicators to track adoption success.

**For Engineers & Developers:**
- Best practices and architectures to prioritize for this topic.
- Specific tools, libraries, or frameworks most relevant now.
- Technical pitfalls to avoid.

**For Policy Makers:**
- Regulatory gaps that need attention in the next 1-2 years.
- Standards and governance frameworks recommended.
- International competitiveness considerations.

### EXPERT CRITIQUE & FEEDBACK ###
Weaknesses identified (fix all of these):
- {weaknesses}

Missing topics to integrate (add analytical depth for each):
- {missing}

Improvement priorities to apply:
- {suggestions}

### REFINEMENT INSTRUCTIONS ###
1. Generate an updated, fully-optimized expert analytical research report.
2. Retain high-quality insights and analytical depth from the previous report.
3. Directly address EVERY weakness and missing topic identified in the critique.
4. Strengthen the analytical depth — add causal analysis, comparative reasoning, and evidence-grounded insights.
5. The output MUST follow the 12-section expert analytical report structure:
   ## 1. Introduction
   ## 2. Core Concepts & Foundations
   ## 3. Current State of Research
   ## 4. Detailed Technical Analysis (MUST include Traditional vs Modern comparison table and Causal Growth Analysis)
   ## 5. Applications & Real-World Adoption (MUST use Industry/Business Value/Adoption Status/Future Potential format)
   ## 6. Advantages & Strategic Opportunities
   ## 7. Challenges, Risks & Limitations
   ## 8. Future Outlook (MUST cover Short/Medium/Long-term time horizons)
   ## 9. Key Insights & Strategic Findings (MUST include EXACTLY 5 numbered insights with Observation/Impact/Evidence)
   ## 10. Expert Recommendations (MUST be broken by audience: Researchers/Businesses/Engineers/Policy Makers)
   ## 11. Conclusion
   ## 12. References (if sources available)
6. FORBIDDEN: Generic statements, textbook definitions without analysis, vague future predictions.
7. REQUIRED: Every major claim must include causation reasoning — not just what, but WHY.
8. Output ONLY the improved markdown report. Do not explain your changes.
